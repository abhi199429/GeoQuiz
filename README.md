# GeoQuiz

This repository is for an android application which is a basic quiz competition structure mainly to understand how the flow works when you are working on complex project concerning end-user with similar interests. I also worked on implementing in-app purchase module to increase money inflow. I used Google AdMob for monetization to show users in between ads. It sounds irrelevant, but it was only for study purpose!
